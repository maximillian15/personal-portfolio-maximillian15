    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>A brief introduction about myself, my background, skills, and passions.</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Morio, and I am a curious and driven individual with a passion for technology and creativity. 
     I grew up in Nairobi, where my love for problem-solving and innovation began at an early age. 
     Over the years, I have nurtured a variety of hobbies, including coding, playing chess, reading science-fiction novels, 
     and exploring photography. These interests fuel my creativity and help me approach challenges from unique perspectives.</p>
